# SNM-Client

SNM Client is a Proof of Concept project for web application with polymer. 

It should be:
  - Easy to install
  - Easy to mantain
  - Easy to extend


Getting Started:

> To run this project you will need

>  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/)
 
> Once you have those installed:
- Clone the [github project](https://github.com/dotnerd/snm-client)
- Open command prompt
   - Go into the path you cloned the project 
   - Run npm install && bower install

Now you should be ready to go do NOT forget to serve the files 
from a web server you can user Chrome Dev Editor if you don't have one installed

> If you're planning to use this as starting project and deploy in production 
> that is a bad idea this is just a proof of concept playground project
> even knowing that if you really want to use this you should probably want to take a look at
> [this](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/articles/concatenating-web-components.html).
